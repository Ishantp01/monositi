 Service Provider Registration Workflow

 Overview
This document outlines the complete workflow for how a user can become a service provider, including all API endpoints and testing scenarios.

 Workflow Options

 Option 1: User Self-Registration (Recommended)
This is the most common workflow where users register themselves as service providers.

 Option 2: Admin Creates Service Provider
This is for when admins want to onboard service providers directly.

 Option 1: User Self-Registration Workflow

 Step 1: User Registration
Endpoint: `POST /api/users/register`
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "photo": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User registered. Please verify your email with the OTP sent."
}
```

 Step 2: Email Verification
Endpoint: `POST /api/users/verify-email`
```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "otp": "123456"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email verified successfully"
}
```

 Step 3: User Login
Endpoint: `POST /api/users/login`
```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "_id": "user_id_here",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "user",
    "photo": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"
  },
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
```

 Step 4: Apply as Service Provider
Endpoint: `POST /api/services/service-providers/register`
Headers: `Authorization: Bearer jwt_token_here`
Content-Type: `multipart/form-data` (for photo upload)

```json
{
  "name": "John's Plumbing Services",
  "category": "Plumbing",
  "contactNumber": "+1234567890",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "description": "Professional plumbing services",
  "experience": 5,
  "photo": "file_upload_here"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Service provider profile created successfully. Pending admin approval.",
  "provider": {
    "_id": "provider_id_here",
    "user": "user_id_here",
    "name": "John's Plumbing Services",
    "category": "Plumbing",
    "isActive": false,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

 Step 5: Admin Approval (Admin Action)
Endpoint: `PATCH /api/services/admin/service-providers/:provider_id/approve`
Headers: `Authorization: Bearer admin_jwt_token`

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Service provider approved successfully",
  "provider": {
    "_id": "provider_id_here",
    "user": "user_id_here",
    "isActive": true,
    "approvedBy": "admin_user_id",
    "approvedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

 Step 6: Service Provider Login (After Approval)
Endpoint: `POST /api/users/login`
```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "_id": "user_id_here",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "serviceProvider",  // Role updated!
    "photo": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"
  },
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
```

 Step 7: Access Service Provider Features
Now the user can access all service provider routes:

Get Profile:
`GET /api/services/provider/profile`

Update Availability:
`PATCH /api/services/provider/availability`
```json
{
  "availability": "Available"
}
```

View Service Requests:
`GET /api/services/service-requests/provider`
